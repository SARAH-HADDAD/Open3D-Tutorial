    "Imagine you want to render a point cloud from a given view point, but points from the background leak into the foreground because they are not occluded by other points. For this purpose we can apply a hidden point removal algorithm. In Open3D the method by [Katz2007] is implemented that approximates the visibility of a point cloud from a given view without surface reconstruction or normal estimation."
